# 👋 Hey there, I'm Kiran Verma 

> _“The only limit to your impact is your imagination and commitment.”_ — **Tony Robbins**

I’m a builder at heart. From data analytics and business intelligence to AI-powered solutions and smart supply chains, I’m passionate about designing systems that not only solve problems but do so with purpose. My journey so far has been a mix of curiosity, coding, and creativity — all aimed at turning challenges into intuitive, impactful solutions.

This space is where my ideas come to life — in the form of machine learning models, forecasting tools, smart apps, and data-driven insights. If you're into innovation, AI, or just love seeing tech used for real-world impact, you're in the right place.

## 🧠 My Favorite Builds

### 🔗 AI Assistant for the Supply Chain  
Imagine an AI tool that doesn’t just talk — it *thinks* like your operations team. This is a custom-trained assistant built on GPT-4, designed to speak supply chain fluently.  
📌 Highlights:  
- Prompt-led analytics for instant insights  
- Context retention 4x better than traditional chatbots  
- Integrates into workflows like it belongs there  
✨ My Role: Designed the thinking flow and tuned the prompts for high accuracy.

### POS - Data Management
📌 Highlights: 
- End-to-end ETL workflows
- Optimized views & stored procedures & advanced SQL querying concepts (CTEs, Joins) 
- Hosted on AWS EC2

### 📊 Demand Forecasting Simplified  
Forecasting doesn’t need to be complicated. I helped build a cloud-native tool that makes demand predictions easy, even with limited data.  
📌 Highlights:  
- LSTM, ARIMA, Prophet under the hood  
- Visual dashboards + anomaly detection  
- Works with Excel/CSV and scales like magic  
✨ My Role: Built models, improved forecast precision, helped shape a clean user experience.

### 🏭 Intelligent Slotting Engine  
What if your warehouse could think about where to place every item for max speed? That’s the vision behind this ML-based slotting tool.  
📌 Highlights:  
- What-if simulations  
- Heatmaps and real-time bin suggestions  
- Greedy algorithm meets smart design  
✨ My Role: Led the machine learning logic and helped define integration touchpoints.

### 📱 Smart Inventory Counting App  
Fast, friendly, and accurate — a mobile-first app for inventory audits with zero tolerance for duplication or errors.  
📌 Highlights:  
- Barcode scanning, data validation  
- Customizable workflows  
- Seamless backend sync  
✨ My Role: Helped shape error-checking logic and made UI super simple for warehouse teams.

### ⚙️ Predictive Maintenance Models  
Built and compared multiple ML models to predict failures and classify fault types — saving time, cost, and unplanned breakdowns.  
📌 Models Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree  
✨ My Role: End-to-end model pipeline, from cleaning to evaluation and optimization.

---

### 📦 Product Segmentation & Retail Forecasting  
Dived deep into patterns of what sells, when, and why. Used data to cluster products and build demand forecasting models.  
📌 Tools: Python, Plotly, Scikit-learn, Prophet  
✨ My Role: Led EDA, clustering, and forecasting with visual storytelling in notebooks.
